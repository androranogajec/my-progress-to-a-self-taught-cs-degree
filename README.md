## My path to a self education in computer science
#### About
Here I'll be posting my achivements and course completions to retrospective and self reflection 



###### Update 3/20/2023
Have had some hard time with rotating shapes, now work with congruence and thinkin in parallel why triangle angles add up to 180
###### Update 7/6/2023
Finally understood why triangle inner angles sum up to 180 degrees, well so simple if to imagine a square it has four angles each 90 degrees, so 90 * 4, 360/2, you get a triangle :)
Also my unit with congurence on khan academy is almost finished, unit test and i'll go up, so only up for me, go go go :)
###### Update 7/31/2023
Almost finished in depth unit with similarity, there was a lot of proportion and ratios, but it was easy for me because i've done this in my Algebra 1 course, so
i'll keep it up, only up!:)
