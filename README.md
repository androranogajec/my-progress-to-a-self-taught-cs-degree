# About
Here I'll be sharing my accomplishments and completed courses as a way of looking back and reflecting on my progress. My aim is to independently get educated in Computer Science for free and get myself an emulation of BCS using resources from [Khan Academy](#KhanAcademy) and [Open Source Society University](#OSSU) which is aligned with the standards outlined in the [CS2013 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md)
