# About
Here, I'll be posting my achievements and course completions for retrospection and self-reflection. My goal is to compelete the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science curriculum independently with [Khan Academy](#KhanAcademy) and [Open Source Society University](#OSSU), which match the standards of the [CS2013 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md).
