## My path to a self education in computer science
#### About
###### Update 2/24/2023
here I'll be posting my achivements and course completions to retrospective and self reflection 
###### Update 3/20/2023
have had some hard time with rotating shapes, now work with congruence and thinkin in parallel why triangle angles add up to 180
###### Update 7/6/2023
finally understood why triangle inner angles sum up to 180 degrees, well so simple if to imagine a square it has four angles each 90 degrees, so 90 * 4, 360/2, you get a triangle :)
also my unit with congurence on khan academy is almost finished, unit test and i'll go up, so only up for me, go go go :)
