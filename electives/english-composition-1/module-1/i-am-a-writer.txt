This is an optional preliminary assignment!

My mother used to tell me that I was good at writing. 
During my school years, I enjoyed writing short essays about how I spent my summer days or other topics. 
Since I am not a native English speaker, most of my writing in English was done in my English classes. 
More recently, I've been writing very short pieces to practice rhetorical techniques.
