Explanation:
Sed i.e stream editor doesn't edit files in place by default 
so you cannot input.txt > input.txt, but also
os when sees redirection of stream it creates a blank input.txt 
before any operations on the actula input.txt before it to sed

better to use 
sed s/patters/substitution -i filename
i - flag that stands for in place
