A propositional formula is satisfiable 
iff there is an assignment of truth values to its variables—an 
environment—which makes it true. 

Explain why P is valid iff NOT.P / is not satisfiable


Explanation
okay so the statement says P is valid iff not(P) is not satisfable, 
which implies not(P) and not satisfable by iff, 
so if not(P) is false and not satisfable is false 
then iff false and false is true, so P is valid
