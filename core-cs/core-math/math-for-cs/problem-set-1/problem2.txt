use well ordering principle to proove that
n <= 3^(n/3) for every nonnegative integer n

hint: Verify (1) for n <= 4 by explicit calculation


Proof. By contradiction.

Assume theorem n <= 3^(n/3) is false
there exists some integers n for which

n > 3^(n/3) is true 

I will collect them into a set C

C = {0,1,2,3...n|n > 3^n/3}

By assumption C is a nonempty set
since the inequality fails for n 

The well ordering principle tells us that
any nonempty nonnegative set of integers
has a smallest element.

let c be the smallest counterexample.
the inequality n <= 3^n/3 is true for all

n < c 

hint part: 

0 <= 3^0/3 true

1 <= 3^1/3 true 

2 <= 3^2/3 true

3 <= 3^3/3 true

4 <= 3^4/3 true

c has to be greater then 4 

c > 4 

but we know that inequality holds for 
any n < c, then it should hold and for 

c - 1,c - 2...c - n

this leads to a contradiction
because we just shown that 
it is true for any n less then c
but our initial deduction has n < c

QED 
The contradiction arises from the assumption
that c is the smallest counterexample
since the inequality holds for n < c, 
but it hold true for n = c - 1, n = c - 2
