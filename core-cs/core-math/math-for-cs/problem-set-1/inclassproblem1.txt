prove that a * b  = n 

id est

a or b <= sqrt(n) where a, b are nonnegative real numbers.

Proof.
We use proof by contradiction
Assume a and b > sqrt(n)
therefore
analyzing the product of a and b

a * b > sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n

which implies 
a * b > n 

QED
this contradicts our original assumtion that a * b = n
we just deduced that a * b must be greater then n,
 since we reached contradiction, our initial assumtion
must be false
