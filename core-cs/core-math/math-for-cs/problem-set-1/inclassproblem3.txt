If we raise an irrational number to an irrational power, can the result be rational? 
Show that it can, by considering sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) and arguing by cases

Theorem. 
sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) can have a rational result.

Proof.
The proof is by case analysis.
We'll consider two possible scenarios.

Case 1.
Assume that sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational i.e equal some m/n

In this case theorem is instantly proved because this 
was our initial assumption which satisfies the hypothesis

Case 2.
Assume that sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is irrational
sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) = i

square both sides 
sqrt(2)^2 = i^2

i = 2

Our assumtion was that it is irrational 
but it is rational, this is a contradiction

QED
sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) indeed can be rational or irrational
