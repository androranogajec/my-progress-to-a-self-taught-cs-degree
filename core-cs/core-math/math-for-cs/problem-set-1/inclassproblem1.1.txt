prove by truth table that
P or (Q and R) is equivalent to (P or Q) and (P or R)

T or T = T
T or F = T
F or T = T
F or F = F

T and T = T
T and F = F
F and T = F
F and F = F

Proof. Direct.

Assume P is true, Q and R are false
then by truth tables

P or Q = T
P or R = T 
P and Q = F
P and R = F

then if 
(P or Q) = T and (P or R) = T

i get 
T and T = T

this clearly implies 
T or (F and F) still must be T

QED
P or (Q and R) = (P or Q) and (P or R) = T or (F and F) = T
