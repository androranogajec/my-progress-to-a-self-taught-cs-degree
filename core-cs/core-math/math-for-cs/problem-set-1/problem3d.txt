A set of propositional formulas P1; : : : ; Pk is consistent 
iff there is an environment in which they are all true. 
Write a formula, S, so that the set P1; : : : ; Pk is not consistent iff S is valid.


consistent - exists at last one truth assignment where all formulas are true 
inconsistent - not consistent :)


S = not(P1 and P2 and P3...and Pk)
