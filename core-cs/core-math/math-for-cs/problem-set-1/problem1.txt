Prove that 
log_4(6) is irrational

Proof.
We'll prove by contradiction
if log_4(6) is rational then log_4(6) = p/q where p and q are integers

Assume 
log_4(6) = p/q
 
then rearranging the logarithm 
by it's properties we get

4^(p/q) = 6

engineering 4 to be 2^2
2^2p/q = 6

dividing both sides by 2
2^2p/q - 1 = 3

QED
Cannot unify the bases to solve for p/q, 3 cannot be express as 2^(of some p/q)
Assuming log_4(6) is rational, this leads to contradiction
