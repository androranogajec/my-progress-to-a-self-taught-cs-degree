Problem 2.
In the course textbook Lemma 9.2.5 states that dist(u,v) <= dist(u,x) + dist(x,v)
equality holds iff x is on a shortest path from u to v.

(a) Prove the “iff” statement from left to right.
(b) Prove the “iff” from right to left.


proof "iff"

assume 
dist(u,v) = dist(u,x) + dist(x,v)

by triangle inequality definition 
dist(u,v) <= dist(u,x) + dist(x,v)

since 
equality holds there cannot exist any shorter path from u to v that bypass x

conclusion
x must lie on a shortest path from u to v 

assume 
x lie on a shortest path from u to v

by definition 
the shortest path from u to v passes through x

then
dist(u,v) = dist(u,x) + dist(x,v)

conclusion
x must lie on a shortest path from u to v, equality holds

QED
dist(u,v) <= dist(u,x) + dist(x,v)
