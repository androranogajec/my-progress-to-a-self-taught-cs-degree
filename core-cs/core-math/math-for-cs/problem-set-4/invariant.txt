problem 1 odd or even:
You have a pile of coins. On each step, you can either:

Remove one coin from the pile, or
Remove two coins and add one coin back.
Invariant to consider: The parity (odd/even) of the number of coins.

Question:
If you start with an even number of coins, can you reach a state with exactly one coin?


Answer:
Assume I start with an even number of coins, i.e parity is even.

observation:
removing one coin, changes the parity from odd to even or even to odd 
removing two coins and placing one back, changes the parity from odd to even or even to odd 

conclusion:
parity is an invariant because it's state is chained and never skips, i.e odd to even or even to odd.
