Problem 3. Translate the following sentence into a predicate formula:
There is a student who has e-mailed at most two other people in the class, besides possibly himself.
The domain of discourse should be the set of students in the class; in addition, the only predicates that you may use are
equality, and
E.x; E(x,y), meaning that “x has sent e-mail to y.”

solving ->

There exists x such that for all y. 
where y != x and E(x,y) -> there exists y1, exists y2 
such that y1 != y2, y1 != x, y2 != x and E(x,y1) and E(x,y2)
