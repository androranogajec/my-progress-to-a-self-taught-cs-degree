a)verify that prop formula P and not(Q) or P and Q is equal to prop

P and (not(Q) or Q) = P and not(Q) or P and Q 


b)prove that  A = (A - B) u (A i B) 
for all sets A, B by showing x in A iff x in (A - B) u (A i B)
for all elements using equivalence of part (a) in a chain of iffs

 
proof.

some examples
A = {4,1,2,3}
B = {4,5,6}
A u B = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Adiff = {1,2,3} 
A i B = {4}
A = {1,2,3} u {4}

assume
for all x. x in A <=> x in (A - B) u (A i B)

first implication 
x in A -> x in (A - B) u (A i B)

assume 
x in A 

then 

either 
x in B then (A i B) 

or  
x not in B then (A - B)

then
x in A iff (A - B) u (A i B)


second implication 
x in (A - B) u (A i B) -> x in A 

assume 
x in (A - B) u (A i B)

either 
x in (A - B) then x in A but x not in B thus x in A

or 
x in (A i B) then x in A and x in B thus x in A 

then 

x in (A - B) u (A i B) iff x in A 


QED
x in A -> x in (A - B) u (A i B)
x in (A - B) u (A i B) -> x in a

x in A iff x in (A - B) u (A i B)
