;understanding:
;Consider the problem of representing line
;segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair
;of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a
;constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and
;end-segment that define the representation of segments in
;terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented
;as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
;selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a
;procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as
;argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
;to try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:
;
