;Modify the make-account procedure so that
;it creates password-protected accounts.at is, make-account
;should take a symbol as an additional argument, as in
;(define acc (make-account 100 'secret-password))
;the resulting account object should process a request only
;if it is accompanied by the password with which the account was created, and should otherwise return a complaint:
;((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)
;60
;((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
;"Incorrect password"
