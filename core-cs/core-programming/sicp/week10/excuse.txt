Why didn't I do all the exercises for homework 10 ?

It introduced client/server paradigm and concurrency.
Brian told that we shouldn't know everything and he doesnt
expect us to know it for sure.

I got the main concepts of the week:
thunk
callback
thread
socket
concurrency
parallelism
serializer
mutex
deadlock

Did the client/server tcp/ip application from scratch
because the original scheme files were corrupted and
didn't work in DrRacket.It's located under cs61a/projects/project2
Did partially the sicp exercises and read the book and lectures notes.

There is no point to do the rest of the exercises because
they introduce unnecessary complexity of the scheme language 
where you cannot understand the code...and unnecessary missing 
function that you have to handle with different libraries or
write them yourself.

I am done. Moving forward.
