This is a tcp/ip application.


Server: 
Listens on a non-blocking socket, handling multiple clients with threads.
Gracefully shuts down with Ctrl+C using a global shutdown flag.

Concurrency: 
Each client is handled in a separate thread.

Socket Management: 
Uses select.select() for non-blocking I/O and timeout.

Client: 
Connects to the server, sends and receives messages concurrently.

#### the above is the init state of the application

#### Tasks:
1 Invent the capability to send a message to a list of clients as well as to a single client. Do this entirely in the client program, so what actually goes to the server is multiple requests.
    1.1 
    standardized the messaging format to be SEND recipient:message 
    server is able to echo to the recipent the message 
    
2. Invent the capability to broadcast a message to every client. Do this by inventing a broadcast command that the server understands.
3. Could #1 have been done with the server doing part of the work? Could #2 have been done entirely in the client code? Compare the virtues of the two approaches.
4. Invent the capability of refusing messages from specific people. The sender of a refused message should be notified of the refusal. Decide whether to do it entirely in the client or with the serverâ€™s cooperation, and explain why. 5. Why is the 3-way handshake necessary when connecting to the server?
