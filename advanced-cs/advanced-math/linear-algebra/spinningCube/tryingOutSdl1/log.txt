Cube vertices have to be from (-1 -1 -1) to (1 1 1) i.e 0.5 of a cube shall occupy each quadrant, 
the center would be (0 0 0), in the case of (0 0 0) to (1 1 1), the center is going to be at (0.5 0.5 0.5)

Used cartesian product to multiply to sets and get the coordinates for the cube vertices, A {-1,1} x B{(-1,-1),(1,1),(-1,1),(1,-1)}
For loop to iterate thru vertices

Rendered the lines that connect each vertex
for example (-1 -1 -1) is left bottom corner or 0 row if though in array structure it connects to (-1 1 -1) left top corner

rotation around x axis tilt forward backward, x remains the same
y' = y cos - z sin
z' = y sin  + z cos
rotation around y axis left right, y remains the same 
x' = x cos + z sin
z' = -x sin + z cos 
rotation around z axis, spin in place, z remains the same
x' = x cos - y sin
y' = x sin + y cos 
I want to rotate both, x, y sequencially 

bugfixes:
- cube was accelerating and because of that warping
	I was using the same points over and over again, I created an originalPoints and copied the originalPoints into points before rotating
